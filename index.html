                        <h3>As a team leader</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being a team leader is both a challenging and
                            rewarding experience. It requires a balance of
                            vision, communication, and empathy. As a leader, you
                            are responsible for guiding your team towards a
                            common goal, ensuring that everyone is aligned and
                            motivated. The success of a project often hinges on
                            the leader's ability to inspire and support their
                            team, fostering a collaborative and positive
                            environment.
                        </p>
						<p>Effective leadership involves not only
                            setting clear objectives and expectations but also
                            being adaptable and open to feedback. By empowering
                            team members and recognizing their contributions, a
                            leader can drive the team to achieve remarkable
                            results and overcome obstacles together.</p>

                        <h3>As a coworker</h3>
                        <p>
							Being a good coworker is essential for a positive
							work environment. It involves being respectful,
							supportive, and collaborative with your colleagues.
							By fostering strong relationships with your peers,
							you can create a sense of camaraderie and trust that
							enhances teamwork and productivity.
                        </p>
						<p>Communication is key to being an effective coworker, but it also requires capacity and polished skills </p>

                        <h3>Experience</h3>
                        <p>
							Very often teams confront misunderstandings, arguments or conflicts, and that is the right time to time out and take a break.
							This will allow everyone to cool down and come back with a fresh perspective of the game (project), its rules and the team they belong to.
